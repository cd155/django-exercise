# django-exercise

Need to start the Python virtual environment. In this way, you don't need to worry about your global settings
```source tutorial-env/bin/activate```

first time, need to run 
```p3p install django```
(Starting from Python 3 virtual environment is natively supported, so it is allowed in NixOS)


run Django in its folder

```cd chefsTable```

```python3 manage.py runserver```
